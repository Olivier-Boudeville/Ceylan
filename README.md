Ceylan
======

This project has for goal to provide, as free software, some high-level, portable, general-purpose developments, and a few documentation elements.

This repository is as such just an umbrella, in the sense that it is mostly empty: its purpose is only to federate and give access to the `Ceylan-*` actual subprojects.
